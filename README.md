   - Download the rover latest releas

     Double click the RoverAIO.exe to launch the application

   - Add the path of the chrome browser to user and system path variables

     The system and user `path` variables can be found in Control Panel

   - Open up a terminal and type the following command, replace the `PATH-TO-SAVE-CHROME-SESSION-PROFILE` with the path you want to save the session data to.

     ```chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="PATH-TO-SAVE-CHROME-SESSION-PROFILE"```

 Open up the application and select the site you want to monitor, click start.


<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

 * If the menu does not display, check the following:

   - Are the "Access administration menu" and "Use the administration pages
     and help" permissions enabled for the appropriate roles?

   - Does html.tpl.php of your theme output the $page_bottom variable?

FAQ
---

Q: I enabled "Aggregate and compress CSS files", but admin_menu.css is still
   there. Is this normal?

A: Yes, this is the intended behavior. the administration menu module only loads
   its stylesheet as needed (i.e., on page requests by logged-on, administrative
   users). -->
